## Description 

[Github Repo location is](https://github.com/flimits/project-horiseon)

The goal of this project is to take a known web site and refactoring the HTML and CSS and..
- Adding Accessibity functionality to the WEB page (ike adding 'alt' to images)
- Fix any mistakes in the coding (if any)
- Make it more efficient in the way it works or more easily readable (if able)
- Update elements to be more proper within the HTML page or CSS that is either redundant or not necessary.


## What was done (Code chagnes made)

During the course of looking at the ask added alt funcationality to all images. Then updated the CSS style sheet to clean up the header and footer selectors. Did some updates of the 'div' to mostly 'section' as 'div' is non-simantic. Moved an image out of css so that I could apply an alt tag to it; which actually increased the size of the main image, but only made it a bit better (maybe).

## Callouts

There was some collaboration from others, but it we were encouraged to be somewhat unique in nameing and layout.
